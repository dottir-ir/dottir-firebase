# MedCase Platform: Architecture Document

## 1. System Overview

The MedCase Platform is designed as a modern web application that enables doctors and medical students to share and discuss radiography cases in an educational context. This document outlines the technical architecture of the platform, focusing on the implementation using React/TypeScript for the frontend and Google Firebase for the backend services. The architecture is designed to be scalable, secure, and maintainable, with a focus on delivering a responsive and intuitive user experience.

The system follows a client-server architecture with a clear separation between the presentation layer (frontend) and the data management layer (backend). This separation allows for independent scaling and maintenance of each component while ensuring a cohesive user experience. The frontend is responsible for rendering the user interface, handling user interactions, and communicating with the backend services. The backend is responsible for data storage, authentication, authorization, and business logic implementation.

The overall architecture is cloud-based, leveraging Firebase's managed services to reduce operational complexity and enable rapid development and deployment. This approach allows the development team to focus on building features rather than managing infrastructure, while still ensuring high availability, security, and performance.

## 2. Frontend Architecture

### 2.1 Technology Stack

The frontend of the MedCase Platform is built using React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces, with TypeScript for type safety and improved developer experience. This combination provides a robust foundation for creating a dynamic, responsive, and maintainable web application.

React provides a component-based architecture that enables the creation of reusable UI elements, facilitating consistent design and reducing development time. The use of TypeScript adds static typing to JavaScript, catching potential errors during development rather than at runtime and providing better tooling support through enhanced code completion and documentation.

Additional key frontend technologies include:

React Router for client-side routing, enabling navigation between different views without full page reloads. This creates a smoother user experience and reduces server load by minimizing the amount of data transferred between the client and server.

Redux or Context API for state management, providing a centralized store for application state and a predictable state update pattern. This approach simplifies data flow within the application and makes it easier to debug and test.

Styled Components or Tailwind CSS for styling, allowing for component-scoped styles that prevent conflicts and improve maintainability. These modern CSS solutions enable responsive design and theming while maintaining a clean separation between structure and presentation.

React Query for data fetching and caching, optimizing network requests and providing a consistent interface for interacting with the backend. This library handles loading and error states, reducing boilerplate code and improving the user experience during data operations.

### 2.2 Component Architecture

The frontend is structured using a hierarchical component architecture, with components organized by feature and reusability. This approach promotes code organization, reusability, and maintainability.

#### 2.2.1 Component Categories

The components are divided into several categories:

Page Components represent complete views corresponding to specific routes in the application, such as the Home page, Case Detail page, or Profile page. These components are responsible for layout and data fetching for their respective views.

Feature Components implement specific functionality within the application, such as the Case Upload form, Comment Section, or User Profile editor. These components are typically composed of multiple UI components and contain business logic specific to their feature.

UI Components are reusable interface elements that can be used across multiple features, such as buttons, input fields, modals, and cards. These components focus on presentation and user interaction, with minimal business logic.

Layout Components define the structure of the application, including navigation bars, sidebars, and content containers. These components ensure consistent layout across the application and handle responsive design adjustments.

#### 2.2.2 Component Structure

Each component follows a consistent structure:

```
/components
  /pages
    HomePage.tsx
    CaseDetailPage.tsx
    ProfilePage.tsx
    ...
  /features
    /case-upload
      CaseUploadForm.tsx
      ImageUploader.tsx
      ...
    /comments
      CommentList.tsx
      CommentForm.tsx
      ...
  /ui
    Button.tsx
    Input.tsx
    Modal.tsx
    ...
  /layout
    Navbar.tsx
    Sidebar.tsx
    Footer.tsx
    ...
```

This structure makes it easy to locate components and understand their purpose, facilitating maintenance and collaboration among developers.

### 2.3 State Management

The application uses a combination of local component state and global application state to manage data and UI state effectively.

#### 2.3.1 Local State

Local component state is used for UI-specific state that doesn't need to be shared across components, such as form input values, validation errors, or toggle states. This state is managed using React's useState and useReducer hooks, keeping the state close to where it's used and reducing unnecessary complexity.

#### 2.3.2 Global State

Global application state is used for data that needs to be accessed by multiple components across the application, such as user authentication status, current user information, and application-wide settings. This state is managed using Redux or React Context, providing a centralized store with controlled access and update patterns.

The global state is divided into slices based on domain concepts, such as:

Auth Slice: Manages user authentication state, including login status, user role, and access tokens.

User Slice: Stores information about the current user, such as profile data and preferences.

Cases Slice: Manages the state of medical cases, including lists of cases for the newsfeed and detailed case data.

UI Slice: Handles application-wide UI state, such as theme settings, sidebar visibility, or global loading indicators.

### 2.4 Routing

Client-side routing is implemented using React Router, enabling navigation between different views without full page reloads. The routing configuration defines the available routes, their corresponding components, and any route parameters or query parameters they accept.

#### 2.4.1 Route Structure

The routes are organized hierarchically, with nested routes used for related views:

```
/
/login
/register
/cases
/cases/:caseId
/profile
/profile/:userId
/admin
/admin/doctor-verification
/admin/content-moderation
...
```

#### 2.4.2 Route Protection

Routes are protected based on user authentication and role, ensuring that users can only access views they are authorized to see. This protection is implemented using route guards that check the user's authentication status and role before rendering the requested view.

For example, the case upload route is only accessible to authenticated users with the Doctor role, while the admin routes are restricted to users with administrative privileges. Unauthenticated users attempting to access protected routes are redirected to the login page, and authenticated users without the necessary role are shown an access denied message.

### 2.5 Responsive Design Implementation

The frontend implements responsive design to ensure a consistent and usable experience across different device types and screen sizes.

#### 2.5.1 Responsive Approach

The application uses a mobile-first approach, starting with styles for small screens and adding complexity for larger screens using media queries. This approach ensures that the core functionality is available on all devices, with enhanced layouts and features on larger screens where appropriate.

Responsive design is implemented using a combination of:

Fluid layouts that adapt to available screen space, using percentage-based widths and flexible grid systems.

Media queries that apply different styles based on screen width breakpoints, typically targeting mobile, tablet, and desktop screen sizes.

Responsive typography that scales font sizes based on viewport width, ensuring readability across devices.

Touch-friendly UI elements with appropriate sizing and spacing for finger interaction on mobile devices.

#### 2.5.2 Image Handling

Special attention is given to the handling of radiographic images, which are central to the platform's purpose:

Images are served at appropriate resolutions for the user's device, using responsive image techniques to balance quality and performance.

Image viewers implement touch gestures for zooming and panning on mobile devices, ensuring that users can examine radiographic details regardless of their device.

Image loading is optimized with lazy loading and progressive enhancement, ensuring fast initial page loads while still providing high-quality images.

## 3. Backend Architecture

### 3.1 Firebase Services

The backend of the MedCase Platform is built on Google Firebase, a comprehensive suite of cloud services that provides all the necessary functionality for the application. Firebase offers a serverless architecture that reduces operational complexity and enables rapid development and deployment.

#### 3.1.1 Firebase Authentication

Firebase Authentication is used for user management, providing secure authentication methods and user identity verification. This service handles user registration, login, password reset, and account management, with support for email/password authentication as well as social login options if desired.

The authentication service is configured with custom claims to store user roles (Doctor, Medical Student, Admin), enabling role-based access control throughout the application. These claims are set during the user verification process and are included in the user's authentication token, making them available on both the client and server sides.

#### 3.1.2 Cloud Firestore

Cloud Firestore is used as the primary database for the application, storing structured data such as user profiles, medical cases, comments, and likes. Firestore is a NoSQL document database that provides real-time updates, offline support, and automatic scaling, making it well-suited for the collaborative and interactive nature of the platform.

The database is organized into collections and documents, with a schema designed to optimize common query patterns while maintaining flexibility. The main collections include:

Users: Stores user profile information, including name, role, bio, and verification status.

Cases: Contains medical case data, including patient information, clinical presentation, diagnosis, and teaching points.

Comments: Stores comments on cases, with references to both the case and the user who created the comment.

Likes: Tracks which users have liked which cases, enabling social features and popularity metrics.

Saves: Records which cases users have saved to their profiles, enabling personalized collections.

#### 3.1.3 Firebase Storage

Firebase Storage is used for storing and serving user-uploaded files, primarily radiographic images. This service provides secure file uploads, download URLs, and access control, ensuring that images are stored efficiently and delivered quickly to users.

The storage is organized into directories based on content type and ownership, with a structure like:

```
/case-images/{caseId}/{imageId}
/profile-pictures/{userId}
/verification-documents/{userId}/{documentId}
```

Access to stored files is controlled through Firebase Security Rules, ensuring that users can only access files they are authorized to view.

#### 3.1.4 Firebase Cloud Functions

Firebase Cloud Functions are used for server-side logic that cannot be performed securely on the client, such as user verification, image processing, and complex data operations. These functions are triggered by database events, HTTP requests, or scheduled tasks, providing a serverless backend for the application.

Key cloud functions include:

Doctor Verification Function: Triggered when an admin approves a doctor's application, updating the user's role and sending a notification email.

Image Processing Function: Triggered when a new image is uploaded, generating thumbnails, stripping metadata, and optimizing the image for web display.

Case Publication Function: Triggered when a doctor publishes a new case, updating indexes and sending notifications to relevant users.

Notification Function: Sends email and push notifications for various events, such as new comments, likes, or system announcements.

#### 3.1.5 Firebase Hosting

Firebase Hosting is used to serve the frontend application, providing fast and secure hosting with a global CDN, HTTPS by default, and easy deployment. This service ensures that the application is delivered quickly to users regardless of their location, with automatic optimization of assets for performance.

### 3.2 Data Models

The data models define the structure of the data stored in Firestore, establishing relationships between different entities and enabling efficient queries.

#### 3.2.1 User Model

The User model represents a registered user of the platform, with fields for both common and role-specific information:

```typescript

  reviewedAt?: Timestamp;     // Review timestamp
  reviewerId?: string;        // Reference to the admin who reviewed
  rejectionReason?: string;   // Reason for rejection (if applicable)
}
```

### 3.3 API Design

The API design defines how the frontend communicates with the backend services, establishing patterns for data access and manipulation.

#### 3.3.1 Firebase SDK Integration

The primary method of communication between the frontend and backend is through the Firebase SDK, which provides direct access to Firebase services from the client. This approach simplifies development by eliminating the need for a custom API layer, while still maintaining security through Firebase Security Rules.

The Firebase SDK is used for:

Authentication operations, such as user registration, login, and password reset.

Database operations, including reading, writing, updating, and deleting data in Firestore.

Storage operations, such as uploading and downloading files from Firebase Storage.

#### 3.3.2 Custom API Endpoints

For operations that require server-side logic or cannot be performed securely on the client, custom API endpoints are implemented using Firebase Cloud Functions. These endpoints follow RESTful principles and are accessed through HTTP requests.

Key API endpoints include:

`/api/doctors/verify`: Handles the doctor verification process, allowing administrators to approve or reject verification requests.

`/api/cases/process-images`: Processes uploaded radiographic images, performing operations such as metadata removal, thumbnail generation, and optimization.

`/api/admin/statistics`: Provides platform statistics and analytics for administrative purposes.

#### 3.3.3 Real-time Updates

Real-time updates are implemented using Firestore's real-time listeners, which notify the client when relevant data changes. This approach enables collaborative features and immediate feedback without requiring polling or manual refreshes.

Real-time listeners are used for:

Newsfeed updates, ensuring that users see new cases as they are published.

Comment sections, showing new comments as they are posted.

Like and save counters, updating in real-time as users interact with cases.

Notification indicators, alerting users to new activity relevant to them.

### 3.4 Authentication Flow

The authentication flow defines how users register, log in, and maintain their session on the platform, with special consideration for the doctor verification process.

#### 3.4.1 Registration Process

The registration process differs based on the selected user role:

For Medical Students:
1. User completes the registration form, providing email, password, name, medical school, and year of study.
2. Firebase Authentication creates a new user account.
3. A new user document is created in Firestore with the role set to 'student'.
4. The user is automatically logged in and granted access to the platform.

For Doctors:
1. User completes the registration form, providing email, password, name, specialty, and hospital affiliation.
2. Firebase Authentication creates a new user account.
3. A new user document is created in Firestore with the role set to 'doctor' and isVerified set to false.
4. A verification request document is created in Firestore.
5. The user is prompted to upload verification documents (medical license, hospital ID, etc.).
6. The user is logged in but has limited access until verified.

#### 3.4.2 Login Process

The login process is consistent across user roles:

1. User enters their email and password.
2. Firebase Authentication verifies the credentials.
3. If successful, the user's authentication state is updated, and their custom claims (including role) are loaded.
4. The application redirects the user to the appropriate starting page based on their role and verification status.

#### 3.4.3 Session Management

User sessions are managed using Firebase Authentication tokens:

1. Upon successful authentication, Firebase provides a JWT token that is stored securely in the browser.
2. This token is automatically included in requests to Firebase services and custom API endpoints.
3. The token contains the user's ID, role, and verification status as custom claims.
4. The token expires after a configurable period (default: 1 hour), after which it is automatically refreshed if the user is still active.
5. When the user logs out, the token is invalidated, and the authentication state is cleared.

#### 3.4.4 Doctor Verification Process

The doctor verification process ensures that only legitimate medical professionals can contribute cases:

1. After registration, the doctor uploads verification documents through the platform.
2. These documents are stored in Firebase Storage with restricted access.
3. An administrator reviews the documents through the admin panel.
4. If approved, a Cloud Function updates the user's document to set isVerified to true and adds the appropriate custom claims to their authentication token.
5. The doctor receives a notification (email and in-app) that their account has been verified.
6. Upon their next login or token refresh, the doctor gains full access to the platform.

### 3.5 Security Implementation

Security is a critical aspect of the platform, particularly given the medical context and the need to protect user data and content integrity.

#### 3.5.1 Firebase Security Rules

Firebase Security Rules are used to control access to Firestore and Storage, ensuring that users can only read and write data they are authorized to access. These rules are defined declaratively and are enforced on the server side, providing a robust security layer even if the client-side code is compromised.

Example Firestore security rules:

```
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    // User profiles can be read by anyone but only edited by the user or an admin
    match /users/{userId} {
      allow read: if true;
      allow write: if request.auth.uid == userId || request.auth.token.role == 'admin';
    }
    
    // Cases can be read by anyone but only created by verified doctors
    match /cases/{caseId} {
      allow read: if true;
      allow create: if request.auth.token.role == 'doctor' && request.auth.token.isVerified == true;
      allow update, delete: if request.auth.uid == resource.data.authorId || request.auth.token.role == 'admin';
    }
    
    // Comments can be read by anyone but only created by authenticated users
    match /comments/{commentId} {
      allow read: if true;
      allow create: if request.auth != null;
      allow update, delete: if request.auth.uid == resource.data.authorId || request.auth.token.role == 'admin';
    }
  }
}
```

Example Storage security rules:

```
rules_version = '2';
service firebase.storage {
  match /b/{bucket}/o {
    // Profile pictures can be read by anyone but only uploaded by the user
    match /profile-pictures/{userId}/{fileName} {
      allow read: if true;
      allow write: if request.auth.uid == userId;
    }
    
    // Case images can be read by anyone but only uploaded by verified doctors
    match /case-images/{caseId}/{fileName} {
      allow read: if true;
      allow write: if request.auth.token.role == 'doctor' && request.auth.token.isVerified == true;
    }
    
    // Verification documents can only be read by admins and uploaded by the user
    match /verification-documents/{userId}/{fileName} {
      allow read: if request.auth.token.role == 'admin';
      allow write: if request.auth.uid == userId;
    }
  }
}
```

#### 3.5.2 Authentication Security

Authentication security is implemented using Firebase Authentication best practices:

Email verification is required for all users to confirm ownership of the provided email address.

Password strength requirements are enforced, requiring a minimum length and complexity.

Rate limiting is applied to login attempts to prevent brute force attacks.

Secure session management is implemented using HTTP-only cookies and short-lived tokens.

Two-factor authentication is available as an optional security feature for users who want additional protection.

#### 3.5.3 Data Validation

Data validation is performed at multiple levels to ensure data integrity and prevent malicious input:

Client-side validation provides immediate feedback to users and prevents most invalid submissions.

Server-side validation in Cloud Functions ensures that all data meets the required format and constraints, even if client-side validation is bypassed.

Database schema validation using Firestore rules checks that documents conform to the expected structure and field types.

Input sanitization is applied to user-generated content to prevent XSS and injection attacks.

#### 3.5.4 Content Security

Content security measures protect against inappropriate or harmful content:

Image scanning is performed on uploaded radiographic images to detect and remove metadata that might contain patient identifiers.

Content moderation tools are available to administrators to review and remove inappropriate content or comments.

Rate limiting is applied to content creation to prevent spam and abuse.

## 4. Data Flow and Interactions

This section describes how data flows through the system and how different components interact to deliver the platform's functionality.

### 4.1 Case Upload Flow

The case upload process involves multiple components and services:

1. The doctor initiates the case upload process through the Case Upload form in the frontend.
2. As the doctor completes each step of the form, the data is validated client-side and temporarily stored in the component state.
3. When the doctor uploads radiographic images, they are sent directly to Firebase Storage using the Firebase SDK.
4. A Cloud Function is triggered by the image upload, which processes the images (removing metadata, generating thumbnails, etc.) and returns the processed image URLs.
5. When the doctor submits the completed form, the case data (including the processed image URLs) is sent to Firestore using the Firebase SDK.
6. If the doctor chooses to publish the case immediately, a Cloud Function is triggered to update indexes and send notifications.
7. The frontend receives confirmation of the successful upload and redirects the doctor to the newly created case page.

### 4.2 Newsfeed Loading

The newsfeed loading process demonstrates how data is retrieved and displayed:

1. When a user navigates to the home page, the frontend requests the latest cases from Firestore using a paginated query.
2. Firestore returns the case documents, which include basic case information but not the full content.
3. The frontend renders the case previews in the newsfeed, showing thumbnails, titles, and basic metadata.
4. As the user scrolls, additional cases are loaded using infinite scrolling, triggering new queries to Firestore with pagination tokens.
5. When a user applies filters or searches, the query parameters are updated, and a new query is sent to Firestore.
6. Real-time listeners are established for the visible cases to update like counts, comment counts, and other dynamic data.

### 4.3 Doctor Verification Flow

The doctor verification process involves both automated and manual steps:

1. After a doctor uploads verification documents, a notification is sent to administrators.
2. An administrator reviews the documents through the admin panel, which displays the documents and the doctor's profile information.
3. If the administrator approves the verification, they click the "Approve" button, which triggers a Cloud Function.
4. The Cloud Function updates the doctor's user document in Firestore, setting isVerified to true.
5. The Cloud Function also updates the doctor's custom claims in Firebase Authentication, granting them the verified doctor role.
6. A notification is sent to the doctor informing them of the approval.
7. The next time the doctor logs in or their token is refreshed, they receive the updated custom claims and gain full access to the platform.

## 5. Deployment and DevOps

Development: Used by developers for local testing and development.

Staging: Mirrors the production environment for testing before release.

Production: The live environment used by end users.

Each environment has its own Firebase project with separate instances of all services, ensuring isolation and preventing development activities from affecting production data.

### 5.3 Monitoring and Logging

Comprehensive monitoring and logging are implemented to ensure system health and facilitate troubleshooting.

#### 5.3.1 Application Monitoring

Application performance and health are monitored using:

Firebase Performance Monitoring for frontend performance metrics, such as page load times, component rendering times, and network request durations.

Firebase Crashlytics for tracking and analyzing frontend crashes and errors.

Cloud Functions monitoring for backend performance and error tracking.

Custom monitoring for business-specific metrics, such as user engagement and content creation rates.

#### 5.3.2 Logging Strategy

Logs are collected at multiple levels to provide comprehensive visibility:

Frontend logs capture user interactions, errors, and performance metrics, with sensitive information excluded.

Cloud Functions logs record backend operations, errors, and performance data.

Firestore and Authentication audit logs track data access and authentication events for security monitoring.

Logs are structured using a consistent format to facilitate analysis and alerting.

### 5.4 Backup and Recovery

Data protection is ensured through regular backups and a comprehensive recovery strategy.

#### 5.4.1 Backup Strategy

Firestore data is backed up daily using the Firebase Admin SDK or third-party tools, with backups stored in Google Cloud Storage.

User-uploaded files in Firebase Storage are backed up using Google Cloud Storage's built-in redundancy and versioning.
