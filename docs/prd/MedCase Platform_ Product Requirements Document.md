The platform will serve as both an educational resource for students and a professional networking tool for doctors, fostering a community of practice around medical imaging and diagnosis.

## 2. User Roles and Permissions

The MedCase Platform implements a tiered access system with two distinct user roles, each with carefully defined permissions to ensure content quality and educational value.

### 2.1 Doctor Role

Doctors represent the content creators and medical experts on the platform. Their role is critical to maintaining the educational quality and clinical accuracy of the shared cases. Doctors must go through a verification process to ensure the integrity of the platform's content. The specific requirements for the Doctor role include:

Upon registration, doctors must select the "Doctor" role and provide additional credentials including medical license information, hospital or clinic affiliation, and specialty information. This information is essential for the verification process and helps establish the doctor's expertise in their field. After submitting their registration, doctors enter a pending state where they cannot access the platform's features or post content. This restriction remains in place until their credentials are manually verified by an administrator.

Once approved, doctors gain full access to the platform, including the ability to browse all content, interact with existing cases through likes and comments, save cases to their profile for future reference, and most importantly, create and upload new medical cases. Doctors can also edit or delete their own cases after publication, allowing them to update information or correct errors as needed. The doctor's profile page displays their professional information, saved cases, and a collection of all cases they have published, establishing their contribution to the platform's knowledge base.

### 2.2 Medical Student Role

Medical students represent the primary learners on the platform. Their role is designed to provide access to educational content while limiting content creation to verified medical professionals. The specific requirements for the Medical Student role include:

HIPAA and international equivalents must be considered in the platform design, even though the platform does not store protected health information (PHI) in the traditional sense. All patient cases must be fully anonymized, with no identifying information included in case descriptions or images. Metadata stripping from uploaded images should be automatic to prevent accidental inclusion of patient identifiers.

Terms of service and user agreements must clearly outline the responsibilities of users regarding patient privacy and content ownership. These agreements should specify that users must not upload cases with identifiable patient information and that they have the right to share the anonymized cases for educational purposes. Data retention policies should be established for user accounts, published cases, and interaction data, with clear procedures for data deletion upon user request or account termination.

### 9.3 Scalability Planning

The platform should be designed with scalability in mind from the outset:

Database design should accommodate growing data volumes without performance degradation, with appropriate indexing, query optimization, and potential sharding strategies for future growth. Image storage solutions should balance performance, cost, and scalability, potentially using tiered storage approaches that keep frequently accessed images in faster storage while archiving older content.

Caching strategies should be implemented at multiple levels (database, application, CDN) to reduce load on backend systems and improve user experience, particularly for frequently accessed content such as popular cases or common search queries. Load balancing and auto-scaling configurations should be established to handle traffic spikes and gradual growth in user numbers, ensuring consistent performance regardless of load.

### 9.4 Maintenance and Support

Long-term maintenance and support requirements should be considered during development:

Documentation should be comprehensive and kept updated throughout development, covering system architecture, code structure, deployment procedures, and troubleshooting guides. This documentation facilitates knowledge transfer and reduces dependency on specific team members. Monitoring and alerting systems should be implemented to provide early warning of performance issues, errors, or security concerns, enabling proactive resolution before users are significantly impacted.
